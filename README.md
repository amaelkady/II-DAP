# II-DAP
IIDAP is a standalone MATLAB-based software capable of performing a variety of dynamic analysis procedures ranging from simple response history analysis to response spectrum and incremental dynamic analyses on single degree-of-freedom systems (SDoF). IIDAP includes a wide-ranging library of SDoF system models ranging from simple non-deteriorating linear and bilinear models to state-of-the-art deteriorating bilinear pinched and peak-oriented responses. A seismic hazard module is also included for the quantification of collapse risk. IIDAP is highly beneficial for both educational and research purposes.
